# OPFS

OPFS stand for Origin Private FileSystem. It's an hidden filesystem, available in modern web browsers. There's no possibility to see what's stored in OPFS unless you add
an extension like [OPFS Explorer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/opfs-explorer/acndjpgkpaclldomagafnognkcgjignd)

With OPFS you'll be able to edit and manipulate files with javascript directly, even if you app is offline.

NCI has release a very simple class based connector to the browser Origin Private File System API to allow you to manipulate OPFS files with almost no pain.

Enjoy.
